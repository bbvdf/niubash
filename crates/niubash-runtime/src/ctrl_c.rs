//! Ctrl+C handling, split by who owns the OS-level signal surface.
//!
//! Windows: the HOST owns the console control surface. The engine's signal
//! backend there is a cross-process file mailbox (`register_signal_mailbox`,
//! rubash `src/builtins/kill.rs`), not kernel signals, so this module's
//! `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` intercept is the sole in-process receiver. The
//! handler only stores a flag and returns TRUE (don't terminate); the REPL
//! reacts at prompt-redraw time via reedline's `Signal::CtrlC` ->
//! `consume_ctrl_c()` -> the host-side trapint framework hooks.
//!
//! Unix: the ENGINE owns the kernel signal surface. `Executor` init calls
//! `register_signal_mailbox` (rubash `src/executor/init.rs`) ->
//! `kernel_signals::install()` (rubash `src/builtins/kill.rs`), which
//! registers signal_hook handlers for INT/TERM/HUP/QUIT/USR1/USR2 for the
//! whole process lifetime; deliveries are drained at command boundaries by
//! `run_pending_signal_traps`. The host must NOT install a second OS
//! handler for that set:
//! - a replace-style registration (`libc::signal`/`sigaction`) would
//!   overwrite signal-hook's action and swallow deliveries out of the
//!   engine's queue (traps would never fire, untrapped-INT exit lost);
//! - a signal-hook-style registration composes (signal-hook-registry runs
//!   every chained action), so each kernel SIGINT would be
//!   double-dispatched: once through the host flag here (`run_trap_hooks`
//!   from the REPL) and once through the engine's own command-boundary
//!   trap dispatch.
//! The engine queue also has no non-destructive peek (`take_pending_signals`
//! drains it), so the host cannot poll it from the prompt loop either. The
//! host's only unix reaction point is reedline's `Signal::CtrlC` — while
//! the prompt owns the tty in raw mode no kernel SIGINT is generated at
//! all (the `0x03` byte is read as a keystroke).
