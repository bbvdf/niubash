//! Curated catalog of well-known external plugin sources (owner ruling
//! 2026-10-02: no vendoring — sources enter the product as a preset list of
//! official origins, fetched on explicit user command; license obligations
//! stay between the user and upstream).
//!
//! The catalog is a *shorthand table*, the same role `owner/repo` plays for
//! vim-plug/lazy.nvim: `niu plugin add oh-my-bash` resolves to the official
//! origin and clones it. It confers no trust — every catalog install still
//! lands untrusted and waits for `niu plugin trust`/`sign` (§12.2).
