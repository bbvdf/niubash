//! Plugin ecosystem surface.
//!
//! The built-in plugin/theme stack is retired (niubash#145, owner decision
//! 2026-09-28): the host no longer ships a pack inventory, an oh-my-niu
//! bundle loader, native plugin presets, or built-in themes. NIU_PLUGINS,
//! NIU_THEME, NIU_THEME_PLUGIN and NIU_DISABLE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS lines in an
//! existing rc stay legal shell assignments - nothing reads them any more.
//!
//! The plugin system is the external bash ecosystem as first-class
//! content (owner rulings 2026-10-02): oh-my-bash, bash-it and
//! bash-completion install over git clone on explicit user command
//! ([`sources`], curated by [`catalog`]), earn activation only through the
//! graded trust protocol ([`trust`]), and expose their real themes /
//! plugins / aliases / completions to `niu plugin enable/disable` through
//! each manager's own selection mechanism ([`assets`]). No vendoring: the
//! license stays between the user and upstream.
//!
//! Recipe-shaped access (lazy.nvim/mason conventions, owner ruling
//! 2026-10-03): [`recipes`] is the data index over the ecosystem,
//! [`download`] the pure-Rust direct-binary driver, [`distros`] the
//! collection manifests (LazyVim extras pattern), and [`ui`] the menu-level
//! view over the same verbs.
