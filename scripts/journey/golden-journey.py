"""The Golden User Journey gate — the owner's 2026-10-03/04 transcripts as
an automated release blocker.

Owner directive (2026-10-04, verbatim intent): "你现在的测试逻辑完完全全
不是按照用户使用来的!交互式你根本不测!…必须改革测试方式" — tests must
follow REAL user journeys, interactive included, not synthetic shapes. This
script walks the exact journey a real user walked, over a real ConPTY
(pywinpty + pyte, the scripts/smoke-wizard-journey.py pattern), in a
sandboxed HOME (USERPROFILE and HOME both overridden — USERPROFILE wins in
this product, a known pitfall, so both point at the sandbox):

  J1 fresh-install first contact
     no ~/.niubash anything -> run `niu` -> the v-banner + wizard appear
     (welcome block, environment panel, "No external themes installed yet").
  J2 wizard full run
     collection "full" -> Apply -> the real `git clone`s progress on the
     terminal -> trust-now question -> "Trust now" (现在信任) -> theme
     gallery lists >60 themes -> pick `powerline-multiline` -> rc written,
     spec written, undo receipts listed on the finish screen -> the
     about-tour keypress -> the live REPL prompt.
  J3 activation
     source ~/.niubashrc in a live session -> ZERO syntax errors anywhere.
  J4 new-terminal x3
     each fresh `niu` session: no "Cloning into" (no re-downloads), no
     "not declared" nags, at most the documented per-source awaiting-trust
     notices, prompt renders.
  J5 daily battery (in the live session left open by J4)
     `ls | wc -l`, `echo hi | cat -n`, `cd ~ && pwd`,
     `[[ a != b ]] && echo ok` — each must produce output, not errors,
     with the prompt still alive after each command.
  J6 trust + activate bash-completion (the owner's exact flow)
     `niu plugin trust bash-completion` -> `source ~/.niubashrc` -> a
     fresh terminal -> ZERO syntax errors (bash_completion included).
  J7 gallery live preview (niubash#170)
     re-run `niu setup` -> the pane below the gallery highlight renders
     that theme's real PS1 (header follows the highlight; a hung theme
     degrades bounded instead of freezing); Esc fast-forwards, Cancel
     writes nothing.

Wave-1 persistence lane (wt79/jw1-persistence, journey-spec P3 + P8-S4 —
the two live P0s #168/#167 plus F4/F5 aged state). Registered as phases
P3 and P8 in PHASE_RUNNERS; like every phase they compose AFTER the base
gate on the same sandbox, walking on the installed state J1–J7 leave
(the theme-bearing source is still installed — J6 only trusts
bash-completion — and P8-S4 restores what it removes):

  P3-S1 reopen sandbox session (aged state)
     a fresh terminal after J5: prompt renders; the picked theme still
     owns the rc (`OSH_THEME`/`BASH_IT_THEME` line intact); the spec
     still declares the wizard's sources; the session reads back a
     marker file a PREVIOUS session wrote (the wake-flag capability:
     a session detects "a previous session mutated state"), proving the
     sandbox HOME wiring survives process boundaries.
  P3-S2 theme-block byte-stability + theme identity across terminals
  (niu#168)
     snapshot rc bytes after the wizard; `source ~/.niubashrc` in a live
     session; two fresh terminals; snapshot after each. (a) the THEME
     block bytes (the oh-my-bash managed guard region — the #168
     battleground) identical after every open, present exactly once,
     with no activated/deactivated flip of the theme source; the
     WHOLE-rc comparison stays as an informational note only, because
     other managed blocks may legally materialize between snapshots once
     their spec declaration goes trusted/declared (release run
     37218948432: the bash-completion block J6 trusted) — materializing
     it is sync's job, not a stability break; (b) the picked theme's
     variable still present, unchanged, on the same framework; (c) the
     string `selection materialized` (the #168 rewrite tell) never
     appears during an unchanged-spec source/startup; (d) terminal 2's
     first prompt row equals terminal 1's modulo clock digits. Green
     expected since wt72/themeback landed (release 1.3.4): the retired
     `wt73-168-theme-rebound` label no longer swallows this class, so a
     red here is a plain #168 regression.
  P3-S3 first-key integrity as product behavior (niu#167 anti-masking)
     after the themed prompt idles >=1.2s (>=1 clock repaint), send
     `echo NIU167KEY` with the driver's Ctrl-U wake DISABLED for this
     one probe: the full word must execute, never `cho: command not
     found`. One labeled probe per session. When it passes the journey
     FLIPS the global wake off (`WAKE_ENABLED = False`): every later
     send runs wake-free, so the gate stops masking #167.
  P3-S4 aged state: damaged tree + bootstrap-failures ledger (F5)
     seed between sessions (the `seed` capability): rename a file
     inside the trusted oh-my-bash tree (the guarded loader must no-op
     silently) and hand-write a spec entry for a declared-but-missing
     origin plus its `bootstrap-failures.toml` memo. The next terminal
     reaches a prompt within 10s with at most the documented one-line
     notices (deferred / awaiting-trust); the explicit verbs repair
     (`niu plugin sync` retries the missing origin readably, `niu
     plugin restore` rebuilds the tree); after healing the spec, the
     final terminal is silent again.
  P8-S4 remove the source providing the ACTIVE theme (F4)
     `niu plugin source remove oh-my-bash` while its theme is applied:
     spec declaration drops, registry record and tree drop, a fresh
     terminal falls back to the floor prompt with no resurrection and
     no syntax-error storm; then re-add + trust + re-enable restores
     the theme in a fresh terminal, and the rc carries exactly one
     oh-my-bash block (no orphan blocks) at steady state.

Driver capabilities landed with this lane (journey-steps.json
`driver_capabilities`, owner W1):

  wake-flag  `send_line(..., wake=False)` sends a line WITHOUT the
             sacrificial Ctrl-U byte, and never retries it (a retry
             would mask exactly the first-key behavior the probe
             exists to observe). Plus the previous-session marker
             file (`~/.journey-wake.flag`): a step's session writes
             it through the shell; the NEXT session's step reads it
             back — a session detects "a previous session mutated
             state" without any driver-internal channel.
  seed       the `SandboxSeed` helper: byte snapshots of the rc,
             spec `[[sources]]` stanza add/drop, a product-format
             `bootstrap-failures.toml` memo write, and tree-file
             damage — all under the sandbox home, between sessions.

`--phases` selects what runs (comma-separated): the base J1–J7 gate
ALWAYS runs first; then the registered phases. `all` (the DEFAULT) adds
every registered phase in spec order (P3, P4, P7, P8) — the gate
exercises everything unless a subset is asked for. `base` is the bare
release gate (J1–J7, no phases). The wt79 single-value `--phase`
vocabulary folds in: `full` = all, `gate` = base, `persist` = P3,P8.

Unlike scripts/smoke-wizard-journey.py (offline, mirror-seeded, one
question path), this is the ONLINE journey: the clones come from the real
canonical origins, exactly as the user's terminal did. CI and local runs
need network + git on PATH; `ls`/`cat` for the battery come from the real
PATH (WinuxCmd on a user machine, Git for Windows on a runner).

Known failures are told, not hidden: each syntax-error assertion checks
the registered KNOWN-FAIL list. A known-fail is still RED (exit 1) — the
gate's job is to tell the truth — but the verdict names the owning ticket
so the red is expected-red, not a mystery.

Spec phases (docs/journey-spec.md §3, lane split §7): wave lanes land
their phases as clearly-separated runner functions keyed by the spec's
phase ids (docs/journey-steps.json) — wt79/jw1-persistence owns P3/P8-S4,
wt80/jw2-wizardspec owns P4/P7. The DEFAULT run is the base gate (J1–J7)
followed by EVERY registered phase in spec order (P3, P4, P7, P8) — the
gate exercises everything; `--phases` selects subsets (`--phases base`
is the bare release gate). Phases compose AFTER the base gate on the
same sandbox — every phase walks on the installed state the base gate
leaves — so a lane's local run is `--phases base,P4,P7` and the full
walk is the default (or `--phases all`).

Exit codes: 0 every assertion holds, 1 any fail/known-fail, 2 skip
(missing python deps / not Windows / no niu.exe / no git / unknown phase
id).

# ── Input-delivery hardening (release run 37149660449, journey J6) ──────────
# On a slow runner the J6 keystrokes (`niu plugin trust bash-completion`,
# typed right after the prompt came up) never reached the ConPTY: the
# screen still showed the startup banner + awaiting-trust nags with NO
# echo of the command, and the 90s wait timed out. Same family as wt61:
# interactive screens drain console input queued while they draw — a slow
# runner widens every such window. Delivery is therefore VERIFIED, not
# assumed (bounded everywhere; the send always proceeds when a bound
# expires, and every retry is recorded as a delivery event):
#   settle — before every send, wait for a quiet screen (two polls with
#            no new bytes and no viewport change) or a prompt-ish last
#            non-empty row. Bounded by QUIESCE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
#   wake   — REPL lines are preceded by a kill-line (Ctrl-U): the themed
#            prompt's clock repaint eats the FIRST input byte after
#            idle, so the kill-line goes first as the sacrifice (and
#            clears stale input before a retry's retype).
#   echo   — after a REPL line, wait for the typed text to appear NEW in
#            the rendered viewport (the editor syntax-highlights input,
#            so raw bytes never hold the text contiguously; and
#            pre-existing screen text does not count); after a menu key,
#            wait for ANY viewport change (menus in raw mode give no
#            echo). Bounded by ECHO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
#   retry  — when the signal never came, resend ONCE. This retries
#            DELIVERY only: the expected-output waits (wait_for) never
#            retry, so a real product failure still fails the gate.
#   anchor — send_line RETURNS only after the command completed: a new
#            prompt-ish row below the typed line (see the ANCHOR_*
#            constants and await_output_anchor below). Sequencing, not

# it during execution and `wait_quiescent` reports "prompt" before the
# prompt has returned. So between two consecutive REPL sends, send_line

        can no longer concatenate two half-lines. The Enter gets its own
        short confirm (its scroll is immediate). Delivery retries only —
        the expected-output wait that follows never retries.

        wake (the W1 wake-flag capability, journey-spec P3-S3 / niu#167):
        `wake=False` sends the line WITHOUT the sacrificial Ctrl-U and
        WITHOUT the one resend — the #167 probe must observe the

        wake byte, would mask exactly what this send exists to test),
        and without the kill-line a resend could concatenate with a
        half-delivered first line. `wake=None` (default) follows the
        global WAKE_ENABLED, which P3-S3 flips off for the rest of the
        run when the product passes the probe.

        Output-anchored (release run 37153503706, J6): after the Enter,
        await_output_anchor holds this send until a NEW prompt-ish row
        sits below the typed line — so the NEXT send in this session can
        never land while this command is still executing (the gluing).
        `anchor_timeout` carries the known-long commands' own bounds
        (trust 90s, source 60s); the default covers everything else.

        `anchor=False` skips that post-execution anchor for commands
        whose completion is INTERACTIVE, not a returning prompt — the
        wizard re-runs (`niu setup`): the flow continues with menu keys
        gated on the wizard's own screens (wait_for), and the anchor's
        prompt-ish matcher must not decide when interaction may start.
